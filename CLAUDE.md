# Beyond Paradise — Agent Instructions

Beyond Paradise is an independent luxury travel editorial brand for East Africa + Southeast Asia. €6,000+ trips only. No press trips. No hosted stays. No advertiser influence. Every claim is first-hand or peer-reviewed.

**Before doing anything, read the master checklist:**
`/Users/tim/Desktop/AI_projects/shared_knowledge/docs/new-site-master-checklist.md`

**Design system (visual/brand rules):**
`/Users/tim/Desktop/AI_projects/beyondparadiseadventures/DESIGN.md`

---

## Mission & positioning

Beyond Paradise is NOT a package-tourism directory. It is a **decision-support engine** for high-AOV travelers asking: *Which lodge? Which animal, which month? Is this operator ethical?*

The keystone product is the **Marine Wildlife Encounter Index**: species × location × month × sighting-probability × legality × verified-ethical-operator — a unified, AI-citable index that no incumbent owns.

- **Tim** covers East Africa: Zanzibar, Serengeti (Tanzania), Masai Mara (Kenya), Rwanda, Mafia Island
- **Kim** covers Southeast Asia: Vietnam (Hoi An, Hanoi, Ha Long Bay, Hue)
- Distinct from WildToSea (WildToSea = "where to go in Tanzania"; Beyond Paradise = "which experience, which month, is it ethical?")
- Distinct from Matlai (Matlai = hotel; Beyond Paradise = independent editorial)

---

## Tech stack

- **Framework:** Astro 4 (static site, zero JS bloat, AI-crawler friendly)
- **Deploy:** Cloudflare Pages — auto-deploys on `git push main` (`github.com/Matlai-Labs/beyondparadiseadventures`)
- **URL:** `beyondparadise.com` (owned, domain connected after first deploy)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS only, no Tailwind. Design tokens in `site/src/styles/global.css`
- **Data:** JSON databases in `data/` (not inside `site/`) — lodges, wildlife, destinations, operators, facts
- **Languages:** English first, German (DE) + French (FR) Phase 2
- **Newsletter:** Beehiiv — free to 2,500 subscribers; form action in `NewsletterCTA.astro`
- **Pipelines:** ≤€20/month total cap across all pipelines. Hard fail-closed — no exceptions.
- **Daily pipeline:** (to be built) research → promote → feed → push → IndexNow → GSC → Bing

### Research provider stack — locked memory

Do not rediscover or simplify the research stack. Beyond Paradise uses the shared Matlai free/cheap-first provider policy:

**Grounded/source research order:**
1. Gemini grounding (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) — primary, free under the normal daily tier, best default for source-safe grounded domains.
2. Tavily search (`TAVILY_API_KEY`) — free-search fallback when `RESEARCH_USE_SEARCH_FALLBACK=1` or Gemini is skipped. If quota is exhausted, fall through.
3. Brave search (`BRAVE_API_KEY` or `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`) — search fallback after Tavily.
4. Perplexity Sonar (`PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`) — final grounded fallback; best citation UX but paid, so keep behind free/cheap options.

**JSON/extraction/structuring order:**
1. Ollama local qwen3:8b (`RESEARCH_USE_OLLAMA=1`) — free local option when running.
2. Gemini JSON mode.
3. OpenRouter (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) with `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, then `deepseek/deepseek-chat`.
4. DeepSeek direct (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) — cheap direct extraction fallback.
5. OpenAI (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, default `gpt-4o-mini`) — structured-output fallback.
6. Anthropic/Claude (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_API_KEY`) — final fallback for stubborn JSON failures.

Supported aliases: `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` = Brave, `CLAUDE_API_KEY` = Anthropic. `BING_API_KEY` is for IndexNow/Bing Webmaster submission, not fact research. `YOU_API_KEY`, `SERPER_API_KEY`, and `EXA_API_KEY` were not found in local projects as of 2026-06-28; if added later, slot them between Tavily and Brave in the free-search cascade.

### Research status memory — 2026-07-01

`pipeline/research/research-daily.js --dry` reports 5 items remaining in the queue (paced at 3/day by design). Knowledge base status after the latest run:

- `data/facts/facts.json`: 813 facts
- Confirmed facts: 625
- Single-source facts: 188
- Pending candidates: 0
- Spend guard on completion day: 4 / 200 grounded calls
- Multi-provider fallback stack (`pipeline/research/research-providers.js`) verified end-to-end this session: Gemini grounding succeeded on all 4 research calls run (no fallback path exercised yet — Tavily/Brave/Perplexity/Ollama/OpenRouter/DeepSeek/OpenAI/Anthropic paths are implemented but untested against live failures)

Verification status:
- `node pipeline/research/kb-validate.js` passes with 0 errors.
- Remaining validator warnings are non-blocking: mostly inline generated sources missing tier assignments, plus a few older confirmed legacy facts where owner independence cannot be fully resolved from source IDs.
- Notable finding from this run: andBeyond Ngorongoro Crater Lodge closed January 2025 for a full rebuild, expected to reopen 2027 — do not schedule lodge-review content work on it until reopening is confirmed.

## Non-negotiable rules

### 1. Tim Score on every lodge
Every lodge review must display a Tim Score badge. Score is 0–100 integer, based on 12 weighted criteria, only assigned after Tim's personal stay. No score = no review published.

Tim Score criteria (12 factors, weighted):
1. **Wilderness position** (15%) — isolation, habitat quality, zero light/noise pollution
2. **Accommodation quality** (12%) — construction, materials, maintenance
3. **Wildlife access** (12%) — density, diversity, proximity, guide quality
4. **Food & beverage** (10%) — quality, sourcing, creativity
5. **Service** (10%) — staff warmth, proactivity, personalisation
6. **Activities** (8%) — range, exclusivity, guides' expertise
7. **Conservation impact** (8%) — verifiable contributions, land, anti-poaching
8. **Value for money** (8%) — at €6k+ price point, value must be extraordinary
9. **Sustainability** (7%) — energy, water, waste, supply chain (observable only)
10. **Sense of place** (5%) — architecture, materials rooted in local culture
11. **Exclusivity** (3%) — number of guests, privacy
12. **Repeat visit intention** (2%) — would Tim go back?

Score bands: 90–100 = Exceptional · 85–89 = Excellent · 80–84 = Very Good · <80 = Not recommended

### 2. Never write specifics without the database
Every price, fee, season, probability, or named claim must exist in `data/` or `data/facts/facts.json` with ≥2 independent sources. If it's not there, don't write it — add it first with proper sourcing.

### 3. Wildlife ethics = non-negotiable
Ethics grading uses **observable criteria only**: documented tourism-impact studies, conservation partnerships, permit status, habitat restoration. Never speculate on "sustainability." Every species × location × ethics entry must link to a peer-reviewed source or official regulation. Re-verify sighting/legality data on cadence:
- **Monthly:** in-season encounter probabilities
- **Quarterly:** operator permit status, species range updates
- **Annually:** IUCN Red List status, operator directory audit

### 4. First-hand authority or citation
Every claim is either:
- **Tim first-hand** (marked `[TIM]`, includes visit date + specific observation)
- **Kim first-hand** (marked `[KIM]`, Vietnam content)
- **Peer-reviewed** (PLOS ONE, Marine Mammal Science, CORDIO EA, IUCN Red List — all in `data/facts/sources.json`)
- **Official** (TANAPA, KWS, Marine Parks Authority, WWF/WCS official reports)

No hedging ("might be", "could be", "seems like"). State facts plainly or attribute them.

### 5. Editorial independence is the brand
Tim's Matlai conflict of interest is disclosed on `/about/editorial-policy/`. Beyond Paradise **never reviews Matlai** (Tim owns it = conflict). All other lodges are reviewed after paid stays. Never accept free stays, press trips, or hosted experiences. This is the core moat — guard it.

### 6. Page structure — mandatory on every page
Read `shared_knowledge/docs/content-page-standards-playbook.md`. Every guide page must have:

```
AnswerBox (50–100 words, direct answer with at least 1 number)
→ Quick-facts table
→ ≥5 H2 sections (answer in sentence 1 of each)
→ Tim Score card (lodge reviews only)
→ FAQ (5–8 questions, 2–3 sentence answers)
→ AuthorBlock (Tim or Kim, with first-hand context)
→ RelatedReads (3 internal links minimum)
```

Word counts:
- Spoke guides: 1,500 minimum, 2,000 target
- Hub pages: 900 minimum, 1,200 target
- Lodge reviews: 2,000 minimum, 2,500 target
- Wildlife guides: 1,800 minimum, 2,200 target

### 7. SEO + AI visibility before publishing
Read `shared_knowledge/docs/seo-ai-content-site-playbook.md`. Key rules:
- Answer in sentence 1 of every section
- Lists over prose for extractable content
- ≥1 Tim or Kim first-person anecdote per article
- heroAlt on every image (descriptive, not keyword-stuffed)
- Schema.org markup: Article + Person (author) + Review (lodges) + Place + Event (migration calendar)
- AI citation config: `public/llms.txt` (exists) + `public/robots.txt` (AI crawlers explicitly welcome)

### 8. URL scheme — locked, never change
```
/reviews/[lodge-slug]/              # lodge review pages
/east-africa/[region]/[slug]/       # East Africa destination + guide pages
/southeast-asia/[region]/[slug]/    # Kim's Southeast Asia pages
/wildlife/[species-slug]/           # Marine wildlife encounter guides
/intelligence/                      # Data hub (migration calendar, price DB)
/intelligence/migration-calendar/
/intelligence/prices/
/about/tim-score/                   # Tim Score methodology
/about/editorial-policy/
/about/kim/                         # Kim's author page
```

Published slugs are append-only. If a slug must change: 301 redirect, update internal links same commit.

### 9. Build must pass before commit
```bash
cd site && npm run build
```
Fix all errors before pushing. `git push` triggers Cloudflare Pages rebuild.

### 10. Internal linking rules
- Every new page needs ≥2 inbound links from existing pages wired on the same commit
- Lodge reviews link to: region hub, species guide (if wildlife adjacent), Tim Score page
- Species guides link to: location hub, operator directory, ethical framework
- Run link audit before major publishes

## Revenue model

1. **High-ticket liveaboard lead-gen** — ZuBlu / Bluewater / PADI Travel sub-agent (€100–300+/booking). Requires formal agency relationship. Phase 2.
2. **GetYourGuide + Viator wildlife day-tours** — 8–10% commission, 30-day cookie. Wire on first wildlife guide pages.
3. **Verified ethical operator directory** — $29–499/year recurring B2B. Operators pay to be listed + verified. Income independent of bookings.
4. **Lodge affiliate** — Stay22 lodging (~$10/booking, fixes Booking.com session-cookie leak).
5. **Consultation product** (Phase 3) — automated AI itinerary (form → AI → PDF), €49–99 each.

**Monthly cost cap: ≤€20 across all pipelines.** Hard fail-closed. See global CLAUDE.md rule.

---

## What NOT to do

- **Never review Matlai** (Tim owns it = undisclosable conflict)
- **Never duplicate WildToSea content** (WildToSea = package tourism; Beyond Paradise = encounter decision engine)
- **Never accept free stays, press trips, or hosted experiences**
- **Never assign a Tim Score without Tim's personal stay**
- **Never speculate on sustainability** — only grade observable, documented criteria
- **Never use affiliate links without disclosure**
- **Never write a specific number without ≥2 sources in facts.json**
- **Never promise encounter certainty** ("you will see whale sharks") — always give probability + caveat
- **Never index content before Tim Score is assigned** (for lodge reviews)
